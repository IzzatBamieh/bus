# Bus Client

## Prerequisites

You need `make` installed on your system. If you've never run/built this project before then run:

```
make setup
```

That's it. :)

## Local Development

Running `make` will launch Elm Reactor after which you should be able to visit `http://localhost:8000/src/Main.elm` in your browser.
